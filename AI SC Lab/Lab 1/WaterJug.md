# Water Jug Problem

You are given an m liter jug and a n liter jug. Both the jugs are initially empty. The jugs donâ€™t have markings to allow measuring smaller quantities. You have to use the jugs to measure d liters of water where d is less than n. 

(X, Y) corresponds to a state where X refers to the amount of water in Jug1 and Y refers to the amount of water in Jug2 
Determine the path from e initial state (xi, yi) to the final state (xf, yf), where (xi, yi) is (0, 0) which indicates both Jugs are initially empty and (xf, yf) indicates a state which could be (0, d) or (d, 0).

The operations you can perform are: 

Empty a jug (X, 0)->(0, 0) Empty Jug 1.
Fill a Jug, (0, 0)->(X, 0) Fill Jug 1
Pour water from one jug to the other until one of the jugs is either empty or full, (X, Y) -> (X-d, Y+d)
Examples: 

Input : 4 3 2
Output : {( 0,0),(0,3),(3,0),(3,3),(4,2),(0,2)}
